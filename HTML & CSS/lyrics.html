        <pre>
            Every day, I wake up missing you
            Wishing that I were to be in your bed
            By your side, tell me that you'll wait for me, patiently
            No one else taking all my time, holding out for you
            
            Baby, I promise
            There's nobody new
            I'm being honest
            There's no one like you
            Baby, I promise (I could tell you, but it wouldn't be right)
            Nadie como tú (we cried together when we said our goodbyes)
            Yes, I'm being honest (I'd like to hold you, God, I wish we could talk)
            
            There's no one like you (down by the water where we used to get lost)
            Aquí estoy, otra vez sin tu amor
            Siento que me cuesta ya respirar
            Qué más da
            Si no puedo olvidarme de ti
            Pido a Dios que me haga feliz
            Sin tenerte a ti
            
            Baby, I promise
            There's nobody new
            I'm being honest
            There's no one like you
            Baby, I promise (I could tell you, but it wouldn't be right)
            Nadie como tú (we cried together when we said our goodbyes)
            Yes, I'm being honest (I'd like to hold you, God, I wish we could talk)
            There's no one like you (down by the water where we used to get lost)
            
            Lost
            With you
            We cry together
            Right here is so cold
            I miss your heart
        </pre>
